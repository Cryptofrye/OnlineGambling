# Winning and losing in online gambling

This repository contains three folders. The folder `Complete` contains all code to preprocess raw data files and analyse the summary data. To run the code in this folder, one will need the round-level raw data provided by Gaming1.

The folder `Share` contains all code to analyse the summary data. All results reported in the manuscript can be reproduced using the per player summary data.
